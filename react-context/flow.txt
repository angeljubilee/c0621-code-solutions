User can sign up.
Auth.jsx renders an AuthForm React element, which is what the user
interacts with to sign up.
User registeration triggers an onSubmit event.
The event listener (in auth-form.jsx) makes a fetch request of type POST to
the /api/auth/sign-up route.
The server, which is listening on that route, will pick up the request,
hash the password, and send a query to the db, inserting the new user.
The db sends back the new userId, username, and createdAt.
The server sends the user info back to the client in the 201 response.
Upon receiving the response, React frontend updates the hash to the sign-in
 page.


User can sign in.
User sign in triggers an onSubmit event.
The event listener makes a fetch request of type POST to the
/api/auth/sign-in route.
The server picks up the request and sends a query to the db to select
the user info from the users table.
The server verifies the password against the hashed password from the db.
If it's a match, the server makes a signed json web token and returns it
to the client.
Auth-form.jsx calls the props onSignIn with the result from fetch.
Auth.jsx gets handleSignIn from AppContext and passes it to AuthForm as
a prop.
HandleSignIn is defined in App.jsx and stores the token in local storage
and updates the state with the new user.


User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page).
When the User refreshes, App's ComponentDidMount runs, which includes code
to grab the token from local storage, and update the state with the user
returned from calling decodeToken.


User can sign out.
Sign Out button is defined in navbar.jsx.
An onClick attribute is defined on the button with a callback handleSignOut
passed from AppContext.
HandleSignOut is defined in App.jsx.  It removes the token from local
storage.
